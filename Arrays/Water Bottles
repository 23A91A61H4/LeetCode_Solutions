Code:-
class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        d = numBottles
        e = numBottles
        while e >= numExchange:
            f = e // numExchange
            d += f
            e = e - f * numExchange + f
        return d

Explanation:
You have numBottles full water bottles at the beginning.

When you drink a bottle, it becomes an empty bottle.

The shopkeeper has a rule: if you give him numExchange empty bottles, he gives you 1 full bottle in return.
