2073. Time Needed to buy tickets

Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2

Output: 6

Code:-
class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        t = 0
        for i in range(len(tickets)):
            if i <= k:
                t += min(tickets[i], tickets[k])
            else:
                t += min(tickets[i], tickets[k] - 1)
        return t
Explanation:

The queue starts as [2,3,2], where the kth person is underlined.
After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [3,2,1] at 1 second.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1,2] at 2 seconds.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,2,1] at 3 seconds.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1] at 4 seconds. Note: the person at the front left the queue.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,1] at 5 seconds.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1] at 6 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 6.
