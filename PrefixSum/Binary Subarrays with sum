930- Binary Subarrays with sum

Input:
nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output:
4

code:
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        hash = defaultdict(int)
        hash[0] = 1
        count = answer = 0
        for i in nums:
            count+=i
            answer+=hash[count-goal]
            hash[count]+=1
        return answer

Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
